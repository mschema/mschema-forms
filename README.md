# mschema-forms

no-nonsense bootstrap.css form generator for [mschema](http://mschema.org)

# Status

This library is in the process of being re-written and decoupled from the previous version of big's form generator [located here](https://github.com/bigcompany/resources/tree/master/forms).

Basic form generation is working, but not fully tested. mschema-forms is considered unreleased `v0.0.0`.

## Features

 - Can convert mschema's into bootstrap.css forms
 - Powered by [view](http://npmjs.org/package/view) module
 - Form generation is completely asynchronous ( even down to the input )
